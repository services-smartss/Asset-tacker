        question: "What is Asset Tracker?",
        answer:
          "Asset Tracker is a self-hosted IT asset management platform. It helps you track hardware, software licences, accessories, consumables, and components across your organization with full lifecycle management, depreciation tracking, and automated reporting.",
      },
      {
        question: "What should I do first after logging in?",
        answer:
          "Start by exploring the Dashboard for an overview. If you're an admin, head to Admin Settings to configure your organization, set up categories, and optionally connect Microsoft Intune for automatic device import. Then create your first asset from the Quick Create button in the sidebar.",

      },
      {
        question: "What's the difference between admin and regular users?",
        answer:
          "Admins can manage all assets, users, and settings. Regular users see only their assigned assets, can submit requests for items, create support tickets, and manage their own profile. Role-based access control (RBAC) allows fine-grained permission configuration.",
      },
      {
        question: "How do I customize my dashboard?",
        answer:
          "Click the + button on the dashboard to add widgets. You can drag and drop widgets to reorder them, or remove widgets you don't need. Available widgets include Stats, Asset Map, Fleet Value, TCO, Health Score, and more.",

        question: "How do I create an asset?",
        answer:
          "Use the Quick Create button in the sidebar or navigate to Assets and click 'Create Asset'. Fill in the name, asset tag, serial number, and optionally set category, manufacturer, model, location, and purchase details. You can also use Asset Templates to pre-fill common configurations.",

      },
      {
        question: "What is the Asset Health Score?",
        answer:
          "The health score is a composite 0-100 rating based on four equally-weighted factors: Age (how close to end-of-life), Warranty (active/expiring/expired), Maintenance (on schedule or overdue), and Depreciation (current book value). A score of 80+ is 'excellent', 60+ is 'good', 40+ is 'fair', 20+ is 'poor', and below 20 is 'critical'. Assets missing data get a neutral score for those factors.",
      },
      {
        question: "How does depreciation work?",
        answer:
          "Depreciation is calculated per asset category. Go to Admin Settings > Depreciation to configure the method (straight-line, declining balance, or sum-of-years), useful life, and salvage percentage for each category. The current value and accumulated depreciation are shown on each asset's detail page and in the Fleet Value widget.",

        question: "Can I import assets in bulk?",
        answer:
          "Yes. Go to Import, select the entity type (assets, accessories, consumables, licences, or users), upload a CSV file, and map columns. The import handles errors per-row so one bad row doesn't stop the entire import.",

        question:
          "What's the difference between assets, accessories, consumables, and components?",
        answer:
          "Assets are tracked individually with unique serial numbers (laptops, monitors). Accessories are items assigned to users (headsets, keyboards). Consumables are quantity-tracked items that get used up (toner, cables). Components are parts that go into assets (RAM, SSDs). Licences track software with seat management.",
      },
      {
        question: "How do stock alerts work?",
        answer:

      },
      {
        question: "How do I manage software licences?",
        answer:

      },

        question: "How does the approval flow work?",

        question: "What is the booking calendar?",

        answer:
          "Use Departments as site support queues (not separate organizations). 1) Create one department per site (e.g. Bangkok, Chonburi) under Admin Settings → Departments. 2) Create support users without Admin, and set each user's Department to that site. 3) When creating a ticket, choose Site — the ticket is assigned to that department so site support can see it. Org admins still see all tickets. Tag assets with Locations for branch inventory; that is separate from ticket site routing.",

        question: "How do roles and permissions work?",
        answer:
          "Create roles in Admin Settings > Roles with specific permissions (e.g., asset:view, asset:create, license:manage). Assign roles to users from their edit page. Users inherit all permissions from their assigned roles. The default fallback allows basic access when no roles are configured.",

          "Set an 'Access Expires' date on any user account. The system automatically deactivates the user when the date passes, sends warning emails at 7 days and 1 day before expiry, and notifies org admins. Perfect for contractors or temporary staff.",
